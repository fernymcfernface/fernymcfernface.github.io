<h1>Current literature</h1>

Some of the current literature I am reading, and will probably finish in about 10 years. All books are free, unless I have marked it with an asterisk. (Last update 18/05/2025)

<h2>Automata Theory and Complexity Theory</h2>
<ul>
    <li> Arora, S. & Borak, R. (2009). <a href="https://theory.cs.princeton.edu/complexity/book.pdf"><i>Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach.</i></a> ISBN: 9780511804090.<br>
        I owe a lot to chapters 1 and 2 for their support for my bachelor's thesis (a short literature review on Complexity Theory). What stuck me around is it is one of the few introductory texts on NP-completeness that showcase methods of showing P is not equal to NP. It is strange that more books don't show this, as it's often the assumption amongst computer scientists that this is the case.
        <li> Minsky, M. (1967). <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/1095587"><i>Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines*.</i></a> ISBN: 9780131655638.
        <li> Hopcroft, J., Motwani, R., & Ullman, J. (2013). <a href="https://dpvipracollege.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/John-E.-Hopcroft-Rajeev-Motwani-Jeffrey-D.-Ullman-Introduction-to-Automata-Theory-Languages-and-Computations-Prentice-Hall-2006.pdf"><i>Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages and Computation.</i></a> ISBN: 9780321476173.<br>
        I am a mathematics student with very little education in computer science, and both of these books have been fantastic at introducing me to the world of Automata Theory.
    </ul>

<h2>Algebraic Topology and Algebraic Geometry</h2>
<ul>
    <li> Hatcher, A. (2002). <a href="https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html" ><i>Algebraic Topology.</i></a> ISBN: 0521795400.<br>
        This book was the recommended reading for an algebraic topology course I took recently, and after the exam I have decided to continue reading it as Hatcher provides a fantastic outlook on the subject. If you are interested in algebraic topology I highly recommend reading this book.
    <li> Hatcher, A. (2022). <a href="https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/TN/TNpage.html"><i>Topology of Numbers.</i></a> ISBN: 9781470456115.<br>
        Unfortunately I started getting into algebraic geometry occured at the same time as my exams commencing, so I have not had much time to peruse the literature - however this has provided a fascinating outlook on geometric number theory that has been approachable enough for me to look at in my spare time when I revise.
</ul>

<h2>Statistical Learning</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., & Friedman, J. (2009). <a href="https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/"><i>The Elements of Statistical Learning.</i></a> ISBN: 9780387848587<br>
        Like Hatcher, this was recommended reading for a Statistical Learning course I took recently and I have enjoyed it so much I have kept reading. For anyone starting out I would recommend its younger sibling, <a href="https://www.statlearning.com/"><i>An Introduction to Statistical Learning.</i></a></li>
</ul>
