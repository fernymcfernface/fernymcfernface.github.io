In 2000, the Clay Mathematics Institute published the Millenium Prize Problems - a set of seven open problems which each carry a \$1,000,000 prize for their proof or disproof (\cite{JaffeArthur2006}). One of these problems is the $\mathcal{P}$ versus $\mathcal{NP}$ problem, one of the most famous problems in theoretical computer science which was introduced in 1971 by Stephen Cook (\cite{CookStephenA.1971Tcot}). This problem was a major development in the area of \textbf{Complexity Theory}, which explores how fast computers are able to compute a program. In this report we explore the development of Complexity Theory, in particular focusing on the satisfiability problem, which was the first problem shown to be NP-Complete (\cite{GareyMichaelR1979Cai:}).
